# Rural-Road-Infrastructure

This is IBM Skill Build Internship project which is connected to the IBM Cloud.

Manual classification of rural infrastructure projects under PMGSY into their respective schemes (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc.) is inefficient and error-prone. This hampers monitoring, budget allocation, and impact analysis. 
The challenge is to automate this classification using machine learning based on physical and financial project attributes.
